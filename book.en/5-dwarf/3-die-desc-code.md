### 5.3.3 Describing Executable Code

#### 5.3.3.1 Functions and SubPrograms

##### 5.3.3.1.1 subprogram

Functions (also called subprogram) may has return value or not, Dwarf use DIE `DW_AT_type` to represent both these two cases. This DIE has a name, a source location triplet, and an attribute which indicates whether the subprogram is external, that is, visible outside the current compilation unit.

##### 5.3.3.1.2 subprogram address range

A subprogram DIE has attributes `DW_AT_low_pc`, `DW_AT_high_pc` to give the low and high memory addresses that the subprogram occupies. In some cases, maybe the subprogram memory address is continuous or not, if not, there’ll be a list of memory ranges. The low pc is assumed to be the entry point of subprogram unless another one is specified explicitly.

##### 5.3.3.1.3 subprogram return type

A subprogram’s return value’s type is described by the attribute `DW_AT_type` within DIE DW_TAG_subprogram. If no value returned, this attribute doesn’t exist. If return type is defined within the same scope with this subprogram, the return type DIE will also be an sibling of this DIE subprogram.

##### 5.3.3.1.4 subprogram formal parameters

A subprogram may have zero or several formal parameters, which are described by DIE `DW_TAG_formal_parameter`, will be listed after the DIE subprogram as the same order as declared in parameter list, though DIE of parameter type may be interspersed. Mostly, these formal parameters are stored in registers.

##### 5.3.3.1.5 subprogram variables

A subprogram body may contains local variables, these variables are described by DIE `DW_TAG_variables` listing after formal parameters’ DIEs. Mostly, these local variables are allocated in stack. 

##### 5.3.3.1.6 lexical block

Most programming language support lexical block, there’s may be some lexcical blocks in subprogram, which can be described DIE `DW_TAG_lexcical_block`. Lexical block may contain variable and lexical block DIEs, too. 

Following is an example showing how to describe a C function.

Generated Dwarf information is as following:

Referring to 1)~5) content, this example easy to be understood.

#### 5.3.3.2 Compilation Unit

Most Program contain more than one source file. When building program, each source file are treated as a independent compilation unit, which will be independently compiled to *.o (such as C), then these object files will be linked with system specific startup code and system libraries to build the executable program. 

Dwarf adopts the terminology Compilation Unit from C as the DIE name, `DW_TAG_compilation_unit`. The DIE contains general information about the compilation, including the directory and name of the file name, the used programming language, producer that generated the Dwarf information and the offsets to help locate the line number and macro information. 

If the compilation unit takes up continuous memory (i.e., it’s loaded into memory in one piece), then there’re values for the low and high memory addresses for the unit, which are low pc and high pc attributes. This helps debugger determine which compilation generate the code (instruction) at particular memory address much more easiliy.  

If the compilation is not continuous, then a list of the memory address that the code takes up is provided by the compiler and linker.

Each Compilation Unit is represented by a **Common Information Entry**.

#### 5.3.3.3 About Go

Finally, I want to describe the differences in Go.

The following picture depicts how C compiler generates the DWARF info for C language. We see it uses DW_TAG_former_parameter to represent a formal parameter, and it uses DW_AT_type to represent the type of a return value. If DW_AT_type not existed, then we know the function return type is void.

While, golang differs from C language，golang support return multi values with different types, so only one DW_AT_type is not enough to clearly describe them.

We can wrote a simple programme to validate, golang v1.15 doesn't use DW_AT_type to differentiate whether this function has a return value or represent the type of return value。As the same as representing former parameter, golang still uses DW_TAG_formal_parameter to represent a return value，besides, it uses attribute DW_AT_variable_parameter to differentiate whether this parameter belongs to former parameter (with value 0) or return value (with value 1).
